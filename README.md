# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides a simple and intuitive user interface where players can take turns and try to get three of their marks (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game includes an AI opponent that uses a random move strategy to make its moves.
